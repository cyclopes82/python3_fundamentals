### A bit of history

Python was created by somebody named Guido van Rossum. And this was actually back in 1989 while he was in the Netherlands.
He was working for the CWI, which is a math and computer science institute. And it quickly became, though a community driven effort and it was overseen by Guido, and he lovingly
became called the BDFL. You might see that word mentioned once in a while, which stands for Benevolent Dictator for Life.
